## Key Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- React with functional components and hooks
- Context API for state management (no Redux needed)
- React Router for client-side routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom design system
- Vite for fast development and building
- Multi-view calendar system (day/month/year)

### Enhanced Calendar Features
- Real-time clock display with 24-hour format
- Multi-day event support with visual spanning
- Event sorting by time priority (current → upcoming → past)
- Interactive plus icons for quick event creation
- Event list popups with detailed information
- Enhanced visual design with thicker borders and better contrast

### Backend Architecture
- Express.js RESTful API
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT for stateless authentication
- Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication
- Middleware-based security (helmet, rate limiting, CORS)
- Enhanced event model with multi-day support

### Database Design
- User-centric data model (events belong to users)
- Flexible event schema supporting multi-day events and repeat patterns
- Activity logging for admin oversight
- Indexed queries for performance
- Backward compatibility with existing single-day events

### Security Implementation
- JWT tokens for API authentication
- Google OAuth for secure user authentication
- Role-based access control (user/admin)
- Request rate limiting
- CORS protection
- Input validation and sanitization

### User Experience Enhancements
- Mandatory field validation with visual indicators
- Real-time notifications with dismiss functionality
- Intuitive calendar navigation with multiple view options
- Professional visual design with enhanced borders and spacing
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Accessibility features and keyboard navigation

### Development Workflow
- Concurrent development (client and server)
- Environment-based configuration
- Modular component architecture
- Separation of concerns (contexts, components, pages)
- RESTful API design patterns

### Deployment Strategy
- Frontend: Static site deployment (Netlify)
- Backend: Node.js hosting (Railway, Heroku, etc.)
- Database: MongoDB Atlas cloud hosting
- Environment variables for configuration
- Build optimization for production
